# -Image-to-Sketch-Converter
a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to upload images and convert them into sketch-like representations.

solution Overview:

GUI Design: Create a user-friendly interface with buttons for image upload, sketch conversion, parameter adjustment
sliders, preview area, and save options.
1.Image Processing: Implement image processing functions using OpenCV or PIL to convert uploaded images into
sketch-like representations based on selected parameters.
2.Sketch Parameter Adjustment: Provide sliders or input fields for users to adjust parameters like line thickness,
contrast, brightness, and artistic effects to customize the sketch output.
3.Image Format Support: Ensure that the application supports common image formats for uploading images and saving
converted sketches to maintain compatibility with user workflows.
4.Preview and Save Functionality: Include preview functionality to display the converted sketch before saving.
Implement options to save the sketch in various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG) based on user preferences.
